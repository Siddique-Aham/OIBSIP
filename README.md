# Internship Data Science Projects

This repository contains two beginner-friendly Machine Learning projects I developed during my internship, focused on classification problems using Python and scikit-learn.

## 🌸 Project 1: Iris Flower Classification

### 📌 Description
This project involves classifying iris flowers into three species — **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** — based on their sepal and petal dimensions. Using machine learning, we trained a model to predict the species based on provided measurements.

### 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains 150 rows and 5 columns:
- Features: `sepal length`, `sepal width`, `petal length`, `petal width`
- Target: `species`

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (train_test_split, Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM)
- Vs code

### 🎯 Objectives
- Load and analyze the dataset
- Visualize feature relationships
- Train multiple classifiers and evaluate their performance
- Identify the best-performing model

## 📩 Project 2: Email Spam Detection

### 📌 Description
In this project, I built a spam detector that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using NLP and machine learning. This is a classic binary classification task where we apply text preprocessing and train a classifier to recognize spam patterns.

### 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes a collection of labeled emails, each tagged as `spam` or `ham` (not spam).

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (CountVectorizer, MultinomialNB, train_test_split)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Vs code

### ⚙️ Key Steps
- Text preprocessing (removing stopwords, punctuation, lowercase conversion)
- Feature extraction using Bag-of-Words (CountVectorizer)
- Training a Naive Bayes classifier
- Evaluating accuracy, precision, recall

## 🏁 Final Note
These projects helped me strengthen my understanding of supervised machine learning, classification algorithms, and working with real datasets.

Feel free to explore the code in each folder, run the notebooks, and try tuning the models further!
